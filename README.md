# ImageAnalysisExercise
Data 1 and Data 2 are for the following image registration and segmentation exercise.
Please complete the following exercise related to image registration and segmentation, submit your code, and answer the questions below. Please do the best you can, and it is OK if you cannot answer all the questions. You can search the Internet to complete the exercise, but please do not ask your friends for help. Please let me know if you have any questions.
a. Please download Data1 from Github. Plot SourceImage and Polygon in 1 figures, and TargetImage in another figure, and past the 2 figures below.
b. Find an appropriate Matlab function to compute the best transformation from the SourceImage to the TargetImage. Please overlay the transformed SourceImage with the TargetImage and paste it below. Which transformations have you tried? How well did they work? Which is the best?
c. Use the transformation you find in b to transform the polygon from the source image to the target image. Please show the source image with the polygon and the target image with the transformed polygon.
d. Please repeat a-c for Data2. Please show the source image with the polygon and the target image with the transformed polygon. What is the best transformation this time? Is it different from what you concluded in b?  How good is the transformation? Write down any observation and thoughts.
